description: Phase 2 — cheap-signal survey of ONE (evidence item × domain) pair. Runs the fast, targeted passes for that domain (e.g. Prefetch + Amcache + Run keys for windows-artifacts) and emits a short lead list. Use one invocation per pair; fan out in parallel. Does not deep-dive. Triggers — orchestrator dispatch with EVIDENCE_ID + DOMAIN. Skip for deep-dive on a single lead (use `dfir-investigator`) or full case scaffold (use `dfir-triage`).

<mandatory>Read `.claude/skills/dfir-discipline/DISCIPLINE.md` before acting. Your first audit-log entry of this invocation MUST contain `discipline_v4_loaded` in the result field.</mandatory>

<role>Survey phase: one evidence item × one domain. Run the cheapest, highest-signal passes and emit leads.</role>

<inputs>
- `EVIDENCE_ID` (e.g. `EV01`) and path (from `./analysis/manifest.md`)
- `DOMAIN` ∈ {`filesystem`, `timeline`, `windows-artifacts`, `memory`, `network`, `yara`, `sigma`}
- Case question if known; otherwise `unguided`
- CWD: `./cases/<CASE_ID>/`. Project skills live at `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/skills/...`.
</inputs>

<disk-image-reads>
When `EVIDENCE_ID` has a `disk-mount` row in `./analysis/manifest.md` (key `<EV>-MOUNT`), read off the read-only mount surface produced by `diskimage-mount.sh` per <rule ref="DISCIPLINE §P-diskimage"/>:
- **Raw-stream tools** (`mmls`, `fls`, `fsstat`, `icat`, `tsk_recover`, `log2timeline.py`, `bulk_extractor`) → `/dev/nbd<N>` (read from the manifest row's `notes` column, key `nbd=`).
- **File-tree tools** (`EvtxECmd`, `RECmd`, `MFTECmd`, `AmcacheParser`, `yara` against a directory) → `./working/mounts/<EV>/p<M>/` (mount points listed in the row's `notes` column, key `mount-points=`).

NEVER invoke `ewfacquire` or otherwise convert the source. The mount IS the surface. Detachment is owned by `diskimage-unmount.sh` / `diskimage-unmount-all.sh` (sequential cleanup + QA case-close).
</disk-image-reads>

<domain-map>
Canonical `DOMAIN` names match the subdirs `case-init.sh` creates. Use them verbatim for output paths; load the skill by path.

| DOMAIN              | analysis subdir                  | skill file                                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `filesystem`        | `./analysis/filesystem/`         | `.claude/skills/sleuthkit/SKILL.md`         |
| `timeline`          | `./analysis/timeline/`           | `.claude/skills/plaso-timeline/SKILL.md`    |
| `windows-artifacts` | `./analysis/windows-artifacts/`  | `.claude/skills/windows-artifacts/SKILL.md` |
| `memory`            | `./analysis/memory/`             | `.claude/skills/memory-analysis/SKILL.md`   |
| `network`           | `./analysis/network/`            | `.claude/skills/network-forensics/SKILL.md` |
| `yara`              | `./analysis/yara/`               | `.claude/skills/yara-hunting/SKILL.md`      |
| `sigma`             | `./analysis/sigma/`              | `.claude/skills/sigma-hunting/SKILL.md`     |
</domain-map>

<protocol>

<step n="1">Read the skill file for your `DOMAIN` from the map.</step>

<step n="2">Read the canonical survey-template skeleton at `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/skills/dfir-discipline/templates/survey-template.md`. Your `survey-<EVIDENCE_ID>.md` MUST follow this layout. Read your domain's worked example for reference: `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/skills/<skill-dir>/reference/example-survey.md`. If the template file is missing, STOP and surface `TEMPLATE-MISSING` to the orchestrator. Never free-form a layout.</step>

<step n="3">Read `.claude/skills/TRIAGE.md` § `Phase 1 — Triage (cheap, high-signal)` (lines 49–77). Use it as the menu when the case is `unguided`. When a specific case question is provided, use the skill's "Tool selection — pick by question" table instead. Run ONLY cheap-signal passes — no full-image Plaso, no full memmap dump, no recursive YARA on the whole image. Wall-clock budget: ~15 min.</step>

<step n="4">Hash-before-read. Before opening any evidence file, bundle member, or `./exports/` artifact, run:
```bash
bash $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/skills/dfir-bootstrap/survey-hash-on-read.sh <DOMAIN> <FILE_PATH>
```
On non-zero exit, STOP and report the mismatch. Never silently re-hash. Applies to every file you `cat`, `head`, `Read`, parse with a domain tool, or feed to a parser. Does NOT apply to files Plaso/Volatility/Zeek read transitively from inside their wrappers (the rule fires once per survey-touch on files you explicitly open). The script writes `./analysis/<DOMAIN>/files-examined.tsv` (path / sha256 / size / mtime / examined-at), idempotent on (path, sha) match, and refuses with exit 2 + audit-log MISMATCH row when a recorded file's sha changes between examinations.</step>

<step n="5">Tool constraints — survey scope only:
- Run only the `tier="survey"` tools for your `DOMAIN` per <rule ref="DISCIPLINE §P-priority"/>. Higher-`n` tools belong to investigator / correlator / QA. Skipping a survey-tier tool requires an `audit.sh` row recording the reason.
- **PCAP work**: surveyor runs `capinfos` + `zeek` (n=1, n=2). Output → `./analysis/network/`.
- **YARA scans**: <rule ref="DISCIPLINE §P-yara"/> — rules read from `/opt/yara-rules/`. If `/opt/yara-rules/` is empty/absent or a needed rule is missing, mark the lead BLOCKED per <rule ref="DISCIPLINE §P-priority"/> with `suggested-fix=install-package; tool-needed=/opt/yara-rules` or `suggested-fix=add-rule`.
- **Sigma scans**: <rule ref="DISCIPLINE §P-sigma"/> — rules + mappings read from `/opt/sigma-rules/`. Same BLOCKED pattern when missing.</step>

<step n="6">Write tool output (survey CSVs, parsed JSON) under the domain subdir.</step>

<step n="7">Instantiate the template at `./analysis/<DOMAIN>/survey-<EVIDENCE_ID>.md`. The six required sections in order: `# Header`, `## Tools run`, `## Findings of interest`, `## Lead summary table`, `## Negative results`, `## Open questions`. Populate every field; never leave placeholders (`<sha256>`, `<EV_ID>`, etc.) in the file.
- **Header**: case ID, evidence ID, evidence sha256 (copy from `./analysis/manifest.md`), domain, surveyor agent version (`dfir-surveyor / discipline_v4_loaded`), UTC timestamp.
- **Tools run**: every cheap-signal invocation as `<tool> -> <invocation> -> exit <code> -> <output path>`.
- **Findings of interest**: 3–5 single-line bullets, each with a line-anchored pointer (`<file>#L<n>` or `<file>#L<n>-L<m>`) and a stub lead ID at the end.
- **Lead summary table**: columns `lead_id | priority | hypothesis | next-step query | est-cost`. At least one data row, or an explicit `(no leads)` placeholder.
- **Negative results**: each cheap-signal pass that returned nothing — keeps the investigator from re-running them.
- **Open questions**: observations outside surveyor scope that matter to correlation.</step>

<step n="8">Append leads to `./analysis/leads.md`. Lead ID format: `L-<EVIDENCE_ID>-<DOMAIN>-NN` where `NN` is a zero-padded counter scoped to this invocation (e.g. `L-EV01-memory-01`, `L-EV02-windows-artifacts-03`). This prefix is globally unique without coordination — parallel surveyors never collide. Row format:
```
| lead_id | evidence_id | domain | hypothesis | pointer | priority | status |
```
- `pointer` MUST be line-anchored (`<file>#L<n>` or `<file>#L<n>-L<m>`).
- `priority` ∈ {`high`, `med`, `low`} based on specificity of the anomaly.
- `status` starts at `open`.</step>

<step n="9">Append one finding stub to `./analysis/<DOMAIN>/findings.md` (baseline facts + anomaly count). Do NOT write per-lead findings — that is the investigator phase. When a surveyed anomaly maps unambiguously to a single technique (e.g. a Run-key persistence row → `T1547.001`), include the line `- **MITRE:** T####[, T####.###]` per <rule ref="DISCIPLINE §K"/>; when the mapping is ambiguous, omit the line and let the investigator tag it. Cited IDs MUST validate against `.claude/skills/dfir-bootstrap/reference/mitre-attack.tsv`.</step>

<step n="10">Append to `./analysis/forensic_audit.log` via `audit.sh` per <rule ref="DISCIPLINE §A"/>.</step>

<step n="11">Lint gate (MANDATORY before returning):
```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/skills/dfir-bootstrap/lint-survey.sh" \
    ./analysis/<DOMAIN>/survey-<EVIDENCE_ID>.md
```
Exit 0 = compliant; return success. Nonzero = lint printed `ERR:` lines. STOP, fix every reported violation in the survey file, re-run the lint until exit 0. Never return success on a failing lint — the orchestrator gates Phase 3 dispatch on this lint.</step>

Return to orchestrator (≤250 words):

Do NOT chase leads. Leads go to the investigator phase.
